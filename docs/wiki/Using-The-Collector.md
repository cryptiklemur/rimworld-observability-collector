# Using The Collector

The collector is the out-of-process daemon that receives telemetry from RimWorld and serves the performance dashboard.

## Opening the Dashboard

When RimWorld starts, the RimObs library picks an ephemeral port, launches the collector with that port, and the collector opens the dashboard in your default browser. HTTP and UDP both share the chosen port. The port changes each session, so bookmark the "open dashboard" link in the mod settings widget rather than a fixed URL.

## The Mod Settings Widget

In-game, go to Options -- Mod Settings -- RimObs. The widget shows:

- Whether the collector is running or stopped.
- The port for the current session.
- A button to re-open the dashboard in your browser.

If the collector failed to start, the widget will say so. See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting) for common causes.

## Standalone Mode

To browse a saved session without starting RimWorld, run the collector directly from a terminal:

```sh
RimObs.Collector serve
```

In standalone mode the collector binds to fixed port `17654` and runs until you press `Ctrl+C`. Open `http://localhost:17654` in your browser. See [CLI reference](Collector-CLI) for all available flags and commands.

## Per-Session Storage

Each play session is stored as a separate row in a SQLite database in your platform's local appdata folder. Sessions persist until you delete them. The [Dashboard tour](Dashboard-Tour) explains how to view and compare sessions.

## Closing

When launched by RimWorld, the collector monitors the game process and exits automatically when the game closes. If RimWorld crashes, an idle-timeout fallback shuts the collector down after a period of inactivity.

In standalone mode (`RimObs.Collector serve`), the collector runs until you stop it with `Ctrl+C`.
